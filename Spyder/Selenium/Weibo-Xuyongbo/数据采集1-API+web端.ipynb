      "2021年12月2日下午，在复旦大学文科科研处的支持下，复旦大学新闻学院联合外文学院，开展第24期人文社会科学“跨学科对话”暨第8期新闻学院“新问题·新方法”学术分享交流活动，主题为 “数字时代的国际传播：问题、方法与跨学科交流”。来自两个学院的八位老师围绕翻译研究的传播学视角、说服理论与国际传播、中俄文学的翻译与传播、社交媒体和国际话语权、新冠疫情涉华舆论中的社交机器人等国际传播问题展开了学术分享，并与在场师生进行了热烈的讨论交流。本次活动由复旦大学新闻学院副院长周葆华教授、外文学院副院长郑咏滟教授共同主持。活动开场，郑咏滟教授指出，数字时代的国际传播研究中，学科交融将成为未来一大热点趋势。语言与传播结合，必将诞生更多研究视角：“从语言的角度探索中国形象与对外传播，激发思想的火花。”周葆华教授介绍了本次论坛的主题与议程，学术讨论会以探讨问题、加深了解、促进交流为目的，围绕数字时代国际传播的问题和方法进行跨学科对话，致力于从学术研究角度贡献于国际传播能力建设。陶友兰教授的分享主题为《翻译研究的传播学视角》，从翻译研究的内涵与外延出发，讲述翻译与传播研究的交叉融合可能性。作为一门交叉学科，翻译研究应该做到“三结合”：对接国家战略；促进学科发展；满足社会需要。尤其是在后疫情和AI时代，翻译研究在突出“国际视野”和“中国特色”之外，关注跨学科研究，应对人工智能对翻译行业和翻译教育带来的挑战与机遇。同时，陶教授以自己的研究课题“《论语》英译本在美国学界的传播”为例，展示学科交叉的研究活力，并期待未来新闻学院与外文学院可以一起合作课题、合作招生、开设课程，进一步开展交叉研究。邓建国教授的分享《说服理论视阈下的中国形象建构》从说服理论出发，探究如何“讲好中国故事”。虽然“全球传播、国际传播、对外传播与对外宣传”四个概念存在差异，但对于当前的中国来讲，四大概念都不同程度上与说服理论相关联。为加强国际传播能力的建设，中国更应当成为具有劝服力的传者：从权威性、可信度和社会吸引力三个维度出发，形成“可敬”的传者形象，并以此在国际舞台中展现中国故事。邓建国介绍了澎湃旗下的第六声（SIX TONE）平台，分析该平台在疫情报道、意识形态内容报道、人情味新闻等不同主题下，如何塑造中国形象。李新梅教授的报告《改革开放以来中俄两国文学的翻译与传播》介绍了中俄两国文学传播的历史发展：第一阶段是从20世纪初到1949年新中国建立，两国文学的翻译与传播以苏联文学为主导；第二阶段是1949年到1965年左右，中俄两国关系处于蜜月期，两国文学传播也出现了热潮；第三阶段是1966至1977间，由于国内外形势转变，两国的翻译传播热潮逐渐退却；第四时期是1978年改革开放至今，两国关系不断升温，为优秀文学作品的传播奠定基础。李新梅教授详细介绍了这一时期两国文学译本的翻译数量趋势，并指出：当下学者应担负起将中俄两国的文学传播给大众的责任，唤起双方对邻国优秀文学的好奇与了解。沈国麟教授分享的题目为《社交媒体与国际话语权》，他指出，在全球传播的时代，我们不应仅关注大众传媒分享的内容，更应该关注平台上用户的内容分享，从Google、YouTube到Netflix、TikTok等，社交媒体已经成为争夺受众的主要平台。而当前中国所面临的国际舆论环境并不乐观，如何突破现状成为关注重点。具体策略上，沈教授认为可以从目前成功案例中进行学习，如华为在全球品牌形象的提升、平澜基金会在国际媒体中的关注以及中国“网红”出海的成功中寻求突破。廖静老师为大家带来了《基于词频统计与主题模型的阿拉伯媒体对中阿关系报道的大数据分析》。廖老师首先回顾了21世纪以来，中阿双方共建命运共同体的合作历程，提出探讨阿拉伯媒体话语中国形象的重要性。然后，她通过大数据分析了阿拉伯媒体在涉华问题上的报道领域、选题偏好和态度倾向，发现：当前，在报道篇幅上，呈奇数年多、偶数年少的趋势；在报道倾向上，呈正面报道为主、负面报道为辅的现象，负面报道涉及新疆问题等，并表现出追随西方强势话语的趋势。未来，中阿需加强媒体合作，形成发展中国家媒体报道的自主性叙事话语，为中阿命运共同体建设营造良好的舆论环境。周葆华教授分享的主题为《新冠疫情推特涉华舆论中的社交机器人研究》。他指出，在数字时代，国际传播呈现出与以往大众传播不同的新模式，传播主体不再仅限于人类，机器成为新的传播主体。因此，有必要通过经验研究分析社交机器人在平台中的存在规模、与人类的互动状况、及其对于舆论的影响。通过更准确的推特机器人识别工具，该研究发现新冠疫情涉华舆论中的机器人比例约为10%；运用主题聚类分析结果，周教授为大家展现了人类用户与机器人用户不同的讨论主题分布；并运用格兰杰因果分析等方法分析了社交机器人对舆论发展的影响。王珑兴老师报告的题目为《疫情期间的中国形象：对墨西哥四大主流报刊的内容分析》。该研究发现，疫情期间，墨西哥媒体对中国的积极、消极与中性报道色彩随月份存在一定波动，波动趋势与疫情发展高度吻合。伴随中国抗疫的有效措施，整体报道色彩在好转。新闻来源上，墨西哥媒体主要使用本国的新闻来源，使用美国的新闻来源也较多。采用越多的美国新闻来源，就越容易有负面的报道色彩。报道主体上，媒体主要关注经济和产业新闻。报道框架上，经济后果框架最常被使用。基于此，王老师指出，中墨两国可以进一步加深互利共赢的经济合作，吸引更多正面报道。最后，官璐老师带来了《基于谷歌图书大数据的国家色彩形象初探》。每一种颜色，都承载了时代起伏的脉络；每一个国家的色彩，都可以代表一个国家的精神面貌，蕴藏着一个国家的政治、经济、文化发展运程。基于谷歌图书大数据的英语语料库，该研究发现，红色是中国国家形象的主色调，“中国红”的形象在建国后得到海外的广泛关注。除此之外，国家色彩形象也存在多样性。在经过热烈的讨论后，本次学术分享会圆满落下了帷幕。此次活动成功展现了人文社会科学“跨学科对话”的生机与活力，也促进了新闻学院、外文学院两个院系的科研交流与合作。外文学院党委书记薛海霞老师，旅游学系沈涵老师，新闻学院刘勇、姚建华、汤筠冰、王晓虹等多位老师，以及两个学院的20多名博士、硕士研究生共同参加了研讨和交流。撰稿：王琢玉摄影：罗   沛绿树红墙的院子 等待您的莅临更多J-School资讯请继续关注我们复旦新闻馆  天下记者家\n",

      "2021年12月2日下午，在复旦大学文科科研处的支持下，复旦大学新闻学院联合外文学院，开展第24期人文社会科学“跨学科对话”暨第8期新闻学院“新问题·新方法”学术分享交流活动，主题为 “数字时代的国际传播：问题、方法与跨学科交流”。来自两个学院的八位老师围绕翻译研究的传播学视角、说服理论与国际传播、中俄文学的翻译与传播、社交媒体和国际话语权、新冠疫情涉华舆论中的社交机器人等国际传播问题展开了学术分享，并与在场师生进行了热烈的讨论交流。本次活动由复旦大学新闻学院副院长周葆华教授、外文学院副院长郑咏滟教授共同主持。活动开场，郑咏滟教授指出，数字时代的国际传播研究中，学科交融将成为未来一大热点趋势。语言与传播结合，必将诞生更多研究视角：“从语言的角度探索中国形象与对外传播，激发思想的火花。”周葆华教授介绍了本次论坛的主题与议程，学术讨论会以探讨问题、加深了解、促进交流为目的，围绕数字时代国际传播的问题和方法进行跨学科对话，致力于从学术研究角度贡献于国际传播能力建设。陶友兰教授的分享主题为《翻译研究的传播学视角》，从翻译研究的内涵与外延出发，讲述翻译与传播研究的交叉融合可能性。作为一门交叉学科，翻译研究应该做到“三结合”：对接国家战略；促进学科发展；满足社会需要。尤其是在后疫情和AI时代，翻译研究在突出“国际视野”和“中国特色”之外，关注跨学科研究，应对人工智能对翻译行业和翻译教育带来的挑战与机遇。同时，陶教授以自己的研究课题“《论语》英译本在美国学界的传播”为例，展示学科交叉的研究活力，并期待未来新闻学院与外文学院可以一起合作课题、合作招生、开设课程，进一步开展交叉研究。邓建国教授的分享《说服理论视阈下的中国形象建构》从说服理论出发，探究如何“讲好中国故事”。虽然“全球传播、国际传播、对外传播与对外宣传”四个概念存在差异，但对于当前的中国来讲，四大概念都不同程度上与说服理论相关联。为加强国际传播能力的建设，中国更应当成为具有劝服力的传者：从权威性、可信度和社会吸引力三个维度出发，形成“可敬”的传者形象，并以此在国际舞台中展现中国故事。邓建国介绍了澎湃旗下的第六声（SIX TONE）平台，分析该平台在疫情报道、意识形态内容报道、人情味新闻等不同主题下，如何塑造中国形象。李新梅教授的报告《改革开放以来中俄两国文学的翻译与传播》介绍了中俄两国文学传播的历史发展：第一阶段是从20世纪初到1949年新中国建立，两国文学的翻译与传播以苏联文学为主导；第二阶段是1949年到1965年左右，中俄两国关系处于蜜月期，两国文学传播也出现了热潮；第三阶段是1966至1977间，由于国内外形势转变，两国的翻译传播热潮逐渐退却；第四时期是1978年改革开放至今，两国关系不断升温，为优秀文学作品的传播奠定基础。李新梅教授详细介绍了这一时期两国文学译本的翻译数量趋势，并指出：当下学者应担负起将中俄两国的文学传播给大众的责任，唤起双方对邻国优秀文学的好奇与了解。沈国麟教授分享的题目为《社交媒体与国际话语权》，他指出，在全球传播的时代，我们不应仅关注大众传媒分享的内容，更应该关注平台上用户的内容分享，从Google、YouTube到Netflix、TikTok等，社交媒体已经成为争夺受众的主要平台。而当前中国所面临的国际舆论环境并不乐观，如何突破现状成为关注重点。具体策略上，沈教授认为可以从目前成功案例中进行学习，如华为在全球品牌形象的提升、平澜基金会在国际媒体中的关注以及中国“网红”出海的成功中寻求突破。廖静老师为大家带来了《基于词频统计与主题模型的阿拉伯媒体对中阿关系报道的大数据分析》。廖老师首先回顾了21世纪以来，中阿双方共建命运共同体的合作历程，提出探讨阿拉伯媒体话语中国形象的重要性。然后，她通过大数据分析了阿拉伯媒体在涉华问题上的报道领域、选题偏好和态度倾向，发现：当前，在报道篇幅上，呈奇数年多、偶数年少的趋势；在报道倾向上，呈正面报道为主、负面报道为辅的现象，负面报道涉及新疆问题等，并表现出追随西方强势话语的趋势。未来，中阿需加强媒体合作，形成发展中国家媒体报道的自主性叙事话语，为中阿命运共同体建设营造良好的舆论环境。周葆华教授分享的主题为《新冠疫情推特涉华舆论中的社交机器人研究》。他指出，在数字时代，国际传播呈现出与以往大众传播不同的新模式，传播主体不再仅限于人类，机器成为新的传播主体。因此，有必要通过经验研究分析社交机器人在平台中的存在规模、与人类的互动状况、及其对于舆论的影响。通过更准确的推特机器人识别工具，该研究发现新冠疫情涉华舆论中的机器人比例约为10%；运用主题聚类分析结果，周教授为大家展现了人类用户与机器人用户不同的讨论主题分布；并运用格兰杰因果分析等方法分析了社交机器人对舆论发展的影响。王珑兴老师报告的题目为《疫情期间的中国形象：对墨西哥四大主流报刊的内容分析》。该研究发现，疫情期间，墨西哥媒体对中国的积极、消极与中性报道色彩随月份存在一定波动，波动趋势与疫情发展高度吻合。伴随中国抗疫的有效措施，整体报道色彩在好转。新闻来源上，墨西哥媒体主要使用本国的新闻来源，使用美国的新闻来源也较多。采用越多的美国新闻来源，就越容易有负面的报道色彩。报道主体上，媒体主要关注经济和产业新闻。报道框架上，经济后果框架最常被使用。基于此，王老师指出，中墨两国可以进一步加深互利共赢的经济合作，吸引更多正面报道。最后，官璐老师带来了《基于谷歌图书大数据的国家色彩形象初探》。每一种颜色，都承载了时代起伏的脉络；每一个国家的色彩，都可以代表一个国家的精神面貌，蕴藏着一个国家的政治、经济、文化发展运程。基于谷歌图书大数据的英语语料库，该研究发现，红色是中国国家形象的主色调，“中国红”的形象在建国后得到海外的广泛关注。除此之外，国家色彩形象也存在多样性。在经过热烈的讨论后，本次学术分享会圆满落下了帷幕。此次活动成功展现了人文社会科学“跨学科对话”的生机与活力，也促进了新闻学院、外文学院两个院系的科研交流与合作。外文学院党委书记薛海霞老师，旅游学系沈涵老师，新闻学院刘勇、姚建华、汤筠冰、王晓虹等多位老师，以及两个学院的20多名博士、硕士研究生共同参加了研讨和交流。撰稿：王琢玉摄影：罗   沛绿树红墙的院子 等待您的莅临更多J-School资讯请继续关注我们复旦新闻馆  天下记者家\n",
